# calculator

## Objective/s

This last project from the **[Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)** aims to give students a novice to intermediate level experience in building a project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It encourages careful use of version control and debugging techniques throughout constructing the calculator. I suggest doing the extra credit as it really test your skill in problem solving and critical thinking.

## Lessons Learned

- Just do it, don't be afraid in writing bad code. There was a moment when I had to rewrite some portions after giving it more thought, but I wouldn't get there if I haven't started coding it.
- Take a break when stuck, sometimes ideas comes to you randomly.
- Creating branches are useful when rewriting code but not sure if it would work.

## Things to Improve Upon

- Adding descriptions to commit messages, especially for more complex changes
- Not sure if some names were unnecessarily long.
- Some conditions for if statements might be unnecessary.
